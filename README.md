# Move37

test

Move37 is a prototype human operating system for the AI age: a system designed to help a person stay organized, protect focus, and make steady progress toward their goals. In this repo, it currently takes the form of:

- a FastAPI backend for auth, activity-graph, notes, and chat workflows
- a React web app for exploring and editing the graph
- a small Node SDK for client access to the API
- MCP endpoints for agent-facing interactions

## Features

The current codebase includes:

- bearer-authenticated REST endpoints under `/v1/*`
- an activity graph with dependency and schedule derivation rules
- note creation, update, text import, and semantic note search
- chat sessions backed by the AI service
- a browser-based graph UI
- a Node SDK with API client and React hooks
- local Docker Compose infrastructure for the app stack
