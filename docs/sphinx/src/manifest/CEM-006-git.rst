Verified Commits (CEM-006-001)  
------------------------------

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any commit must be a verified commit, i.e., it must contain cryptographic
evidence that it was made by the person it claims to be from.


Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

- Authenticity: Signed commits verify the true author.
- Integrity: Guarantees code has not been altered since signing.
- Accountability: Every change is traceable to a verified individual.
- Trust in collaboration: Maintains trust in multi-contributor projects.
- Security: Helps protect against supply chain attacks.

Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install GPG
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnupg

   # Generate a new GPG key (select RSA with a 4096 bits key, use your GitHub user name and email when prompted)
   gpg --full-generate-key

   # List your GPG keys to find your key ID
   # Look for the line:
   # sec   rsa4096/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 2026-01-28 [SC]
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

   # Copy your public key to the clipboard (replace XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your key ID)
   gpg --armor --export XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   # Add your GPG public key to GitHub:
   #   - Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New GPG key
   #   - Paste the key and save

   # Configure Git to use your signing key for this repository
   git config user.signingkey XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   git config commit.gpgsign true

   # Now, all commits in this repo will be signed by default
   git commit -m "feat(git): Look at that, it's verified!"
