Outcome Driven Development (ODD) (CEM-004)
==========================================

For context, refer to ODD - Outcome Driven Development.

State Machine (CEM-004-000)  
--------------------------------------

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manifest specifies a formal, human-and-machine-readable language for
defining the artifacts of intent — desired outcomes and the processes to
achieve them — using state machines.

Language Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Defined using a structured format (e.g., YAML or JSON).
- Capable of representing states, transitions, events, and side effects.
- Includes mechanisms for defining success criteria (outcomes).
- Designed for tool support, enabling generation of visual diagrams and executable boilerplate code.
- The formalism favors machine-centric expression to improve prompts to coding agents.

Human-Centric (Sub-optimal for Agents)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   The trial site starts in the 'Setup' phase. Once we get the IRB approval,
   we can move to 'Ready.' However, we also need the initial drug batch to
   arrive. When both are done, the site becomes 'Active.' If the site fails
   the safety audit at any point, we have to move it to 'Suspended' and it
   might need to go back to 'Setup' or stay 'Suspended' indefinitely.

       from: "*" # Any state
       to: SITE_SUSPENDED
       side_effects: [HALT_PATIENT_RECRUITMENT, TRIGGER_COMPLIANCE_ALARM]

   cycles:
     - allowed: [SITE_SUSPENDED, SITE_IDENTIFIED] # Remediation path

State Machine Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The state machine may be deterministic or nondeterministic and represented by
acyclic, cyclic, oriented, or non-oriented graphs. Where applicable, the state
machine can also be represented by a Euclidean graph.

Specification

The current draft schema for the ODD state machine definition is documented in
the following file: File.

   * - states
     - A map of all possible states
     - VERIFIED, PROFILE_SETUP
   * - transitions
     - Rules for moving between states, triggered by events
     - INITIATED -> VERIFIED on event EMAIL_CONFIRMED
   * - success_criteria
     - Condition(s) that define a successful outcome
     - state == 'PROFILE_SETUP'

The team will hold a follow-up meeting to finalize the ODD language specification
and agree on a timeline for implementation. The meeting is scheduled for Date.
